# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a modern web application that enables users to browse Azure Marketplace VM Images through a hierarchical interface. The application provides OAuth2/OIDC authentication via Azure Multi-Tenant App registration, allowing users to access their Azure subscriptions and browse VM images organized by Publisher → Offers → SKUs. The portal includes functionality to copy image details for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate using OAuth2/OIDC with my Azure account, so that I can securely access my Azure subscriptions and VM marketplace data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL present an Azure OAuth2/OIDC login interface
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL obtain necessary permissions to access Azure Resource Manager APIs
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to re-authentication
5. IF a user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL display permission requirements and guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to select from my available Azure subscriptions, so that I can browse VM images within the context of a specific subscription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes authentication THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display all accessible Azure subscriptions
2. WHEN a user selects a subscription THEN the system SHALL store the selection for the current session
3. WHEN no subscriptions are available THEN the system SHALL display appropriate messaging about access requirements
4. WHEN subscription data fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide error details and retry functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse VM images in a hierarchical structure (Publisher → Offers → SKUs), so that I can efficiently navigate through the Azure Marketplace catalog.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a subscription THEN the system SHALL display all available Publishers for VM images
2. WHEN a user clicks on a Publisher THEN the system SHALL navigate to show all Offers for that Publisher
3. WHEN a user clicks on an Offer THEN the system SHALL display all SKUs for that Offer
4. WHEN navigating between levels THEN the system SHALL provide clear breadcrumb navigation
5. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display error messages and provide retry options
6. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to copy VM image details in a format suitable for Infrastructure as Code templates, so that I can quickly integrate selected images into my deployment scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing SKU details THEN the system SHALL provide a copy function for image references
2. WHEN a user clicks copy THEN the system SHALL format the data appropriately for common IaC tools (ARM, Terraform, Bicep)
3. WHEN copy is successful THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation
4. WHEN copy fails THEN the system SHALL display error messaging
5. IF multiple format options exist THEN the system SHALL allow users to select their preferred format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a modern, responsive interface, so that I can efficiently browse VM images on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on any device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and clear visual hierarchy
3. WHEN displaying large lists THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtual scrolling for performance
4. WHEN searching is needed THEN the system SHALL provide filtering capabilities within each level
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to efficiently handle API rate limits and large datasets, so that I can browse VM images without performance issues or service interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting and retry logic
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and inform users of delays
3. WHEN loading large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies to improve performance
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide offline capabilities where possible
5. WHEN API responses are slow THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and allow cancellation
